### Overview

The **Approved Real Estate** route lets you qualify for Grenada citizenship by investing in a project that has received formal program approval. It’s a transparent, asset-backed alternative to the donation path and suits applicants who prefer **capital preservation** (with potential rental participation) over a pure contribution. Processing typically completes in **~6 months** for clean files.

> **What qualifies?** Hospitality or residential developments that have been vetted and approved by the program authority. Inventory can be offered as **project shares** or **condo/freehold title**, depending on the development.

---

### Investment Overview

**Minimum entry:** **USD 270,000** into an **approved project**, plus due diligence and processing fees. A **five-year minimum holding period** applies before eligible exit or resale under the governing rules.

**Ownership formats**

- **Share units** — fractional participation in the project entity; lower ticket, simpler resale framework in many projects.
- **Condo/freehold title** — deeded units at higher entry points; useful if you value occasional use or personal allocation.

**Cash flow & exit**

- Rental participation (if offered) and **yields are not guaranteed**; they depend on operator performance and allocation policies.
- Exit is subject to **project-specific resale windows** and the program’s eligibility rules in effect at time of sale.

**Safeguards & compliance**

- Escrow arrangements and **approved legal templates** are used for reservation, purchase and title/transfer.
- All adult applicants undergo **enhanced due diligence** and a brief **program interview**.

> **Indicative budgeting:** We recommend **USD 350,000+** in liquid funds to cover the investment entry, government charges and closing/third-party costs.

### Comparison with Provincial Entrepreneur Programs

Entrepreneur visas require **active management**, job creation and business performance monitoring. Grenada’s approved real estate route is **capital-focused**:

| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Core requirement | Qualifying capital & hold period | Business setup, jobs, operations  |
| Time commitment  | Passive                          | Active, ongoing                   |
| Risk vector      | Project & exit windows           | Business performance & compliance |
| Suitability      | Capital-first families           | Hands-on operators                |
