### Overview

The donation route funds Grenada’s National Transformation Fund and is the most predictable path to citizenship.

### Investment Overview

Make a one-time NTF contribution after approval-in-principle. Due-diligence, processing, interview and passport fees apply per person.

### Comparison with Provincial Entrepreneur Programs

For investors prioritising speed and simplicity, the NTF route typically has fewer moving parts than jurisdictional entrepreneur visas, which require job creation and operating a business.

### Why Grenada

Efficient processing, reputable governance, and competitive total cost for families.

### Why Choose Us

We streamline eligibility, documentation and agent coordination to minimise back-and-forth and keep your file compliant.
