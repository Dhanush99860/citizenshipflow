<Section title="Key updates for 2025">
  <Callout variant="info" title="At a glance">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Qualifying salary (from 1 Jan 2025):</strong> S$5,600 general / <strong>S$6,200</strong> financial services; age-progressive.</li>
      <li><strong>COMPASS</strong> still required for most new EPs and renewals: points across <em>Salary</em>, <em>Qualifications</em>, <em>Diversity</em>, <em>Local Employment</em> with possible firm-level bonuses.</li>
      <li><strong>Hiring flow:</strong> entity setup → job posting (FCF) → EP application → IPA → onboarding & compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </Callout>
</Section>

## What you’ll learn

- How COMPASS points are awarded and where most files fail.
- Setting the right salary against the <em>age-progressive</em> baseline.
- Typical filing timeline and how to cut idle time between steps.
- Documentary hygiene to avoid needless <em>clarifications</em> or rejections.

## COMPASS in practice

- **C1 Salary:** higher fixed monthly pay → more points (benchmarked by sector & age).  
- **C2 Qualifications:** recognised degree/equivalency pathways.  
- **C3 Diversity:** contributes to a balanced nationality mix.  
- **C4 Local Employment:** supports local PMET outcomes.  
- **Bonus categories (where relevant):** skills bonus (shortage roles) and strategic economic priority.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Common point leaks">
  Mis-matched job scope vs. market salary, unverified degrees, and incomplete company profiling (hurts C3/C4). Align title, JD and comp with MOM benchmarks.
</Callout>

## Salary baseline (2025)

- **General:** S$5,600 minimum for a new EP at age 23; rises with age/experience.  
- **Financial services:** **S$6,200** starting point; likewise age-progressive.  
- Renewals under new thresholds follow the same logic — review early.
