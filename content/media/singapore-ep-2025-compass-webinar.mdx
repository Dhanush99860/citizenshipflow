## What is the Start-Up Visa?

Canada’s Start-Up Visa (SUV) grants **permanent residence** to founders building an innovative, scalable business that is supported by a government-designated organization (incubator, angel group, or venture capital fund).

> **Who qualifies?**  
> Innovative business concept, a **Letter of Support (LoS)** from a designated organization, **CLB 5** language ability, sufficient **settlement funds**, and an intention to live **outside Québec**.

## Core eligibility

- **Letter of Support (LoS)** from a designated incubator, angel group, or VC fund. The organization also sends a **Commitment Certificate** directly to IRCC.  
- **Qualifying business** that can create jobs in Canada and compete globally.  
- **Ownership & control** meeting SUV voting-rights rules (see below).  
- **Language**: at least **CLB 5** in English or French.  
- **Settlement funds** sufficient for family size.  
- **Admissibility**: medical, biometrics, police certificates, and background checks.

## Designated organizations (DOs)

Canada authorizes three DO types to issue Letters of Support.

### Incubators
Best for early-stage teams seeking programming, mentorship, and community. Selection typically considers founder/market insight, execution plan, and the Canadian jobs angle.

### Angel groups
Focus on early financing and mentor networks. Many expect evidence of **traction** (paying users, pilots, LOIs) and a clear plan for use of funds in Canada.

### Venture capital funds
Back companies with significant market potential and scalable models. VCs evaluate team quality, defensibility, path to scale, and whether core operations will be built in Canada.

> **Essential vs non-essential applicants**  
> Up to **five** owners can be included. A DO may mark founders as **essential**. If an essential founder’s application is refused or withdrawn, the entire file can be refused.

## Ownership & control — quick rules

- Each applying founder must hold **≥ 10%** of the voting rights.  
- All applying founders **plus** the designated organization(s) must jointly hold **> 50%** of the voting rights.  
- Maintain qualifying ownership and control **from application to landing**.  
- Incorporate in Canada (usually during/after DO process) and carry on business in Canada.

## Language & funds

> **Practical checklist**  
> Target **CLB 5** (many use IELTS General). Keep settlement funds **liquid** and **verifiable**. Align the **cap table** to SUV thresholds, document roles/vesting, and keep founder employment agreements tidy.

### Language (CLB 5)
CLB 5 corresponds to a modest intermediate ability in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Most founders meet it with IELTS General, CELPIP, TEF, or TCF. Always confirm the official **CLB conversion** when booking.

### Settlement funds
IRCC updates minimum funds annually. Treat the table as a floor; founders with dependants or higher burn should plan above the minimum. Funds must be **readily available** and traceable.

## Step-by-step: from idea to PR

1. **Shape a qualifying business** — Problem, solution, target market, moat, and your **Canada plan** (hiring, R&D, partnerships). Prepare a lean business plan and a 10–12 slide deck.  
2. **Engage designated organizations** — Shortlist relevant incubators/angels/VCs. Tailor the deck, highlight traction and planned Canadian activities, and prepare for diligence (market sizing, GTM, IP/tech, cap table, references).  
3. **Secure the Letter of Support** — On acceptance, your DO issues an LoS to you and files a Commitment Certificate with IRCC. Confirm if any founders are marked **essential**.  
4. **File the PR application** — Submit forms, LoS, police certificates, medicals/biometrics, language proof, and settlement funds. Keep corporate records (share registers, resolutions) organized.  
5. **(Optional) Work permit** — Some founders obtain an LMIA-exempt work permit (SUV stream or other C-codes) to build in Canada while PR is processing.

## Documents you’ll prepare

- Passports and civil-status documents for all applicants.  
- Language test results meeting **CLB 5**.  
- Proof of **settlement funds** (bank letters/statements).  
- Police certificates, medical exams, and biometrics.  
- Corporate set: articles, share register/cap table, founder agreements, option/vesting docs, IP assignments.  
- Business evidence: deck, plan, traction (users, pilots, contracts), Canada activity plan.  
- **Letter of Support** (your copy) and DO **Commitment Certificate** (sent by DO to IRCC).

## Processing & timeline

SUV is not a fast-track by default. Timelines vary by DO evaluation, founder readiness, and IRCC queues. Founders who must start in Canada sooner often use a temporary **work permit** while PR runs in parallel.

> **Keep your file current**  
> Update IRCC if you change roles, ownership, address, or family composition. Notify your DO of major milestones; they may be contacted by IRCC.

## Costs & fees (typical buckets)

- IRCC application fees and biometrics for each applicant.  
- Medical exam and police-certificate costs.  
- DO program fees or investment terms (varies by organization).  
- Company formation, tax, and legal housekeeping in Canada.

## After PR — what to expect

- **PR card** on landing and access to provincial health coverage (after any applicable waiting period).  
- Ability to live and work anywhere in Canada **except Québec** (SUV is a federal program outside Québec).  
- Keep residency days to maintain PR; citizenship may be available after meeting physical-presence rules.

## Common pitfalls

- Rushing DO outreach with a generic deck and no Canada plan.  
- Cap tables that fail the **10%** and **>50%** voting-rights rules.  
- Settlement funds that are locked, untraceable, or below the annual minimum.  
- Language results below CLB 5 or expired test reports.  
- Marking a clearly non-critical founder as **essential**.

## FAQs

### Can I include my family?
Yes. Spouses/partners and dependent children can be included for permanent residence.

### How many founders can apply?
Up to **five** owners. A DO may mark certain founders as **essential**; if an essential applicant is refused or withdraws, the file can be refused.

### Do I need to invest a fixed amount?
There is **no fixed government investment**. Terms depend on your designated organization (program fees, equity, or investment) and your company’s needs.

### Is French required?
No. English **or** French is acceptable. You must reach at least **CLB 5** in one official language.

### Can I live in Québec on SUV?
No. SUV is a federal program for all provinces and territories **except Québec**.

### What if my LoS expires while IRCC is processing?
LoS validity is set by the DO. If timing slips, coordinate early with your DO for re-issuance or an extension letter.
