### Overview

Express Entry manages three programs—**FSW**, **CEC**, and **FST**—using the **CRS** to rank profiles. Periodic draws invite the top candidates to apply for PR.

### Salary Overview

Most applicants transition to PR first and then take employment in Canada; compensation varies by occupation and province. Salaries generally track provincial labour-market data.

### Comparison

- **Express Entry**: direct PR after ITA → eAPR → approval.
- **PNP**: nomination first (adds points), then PR.

### Why Canada

Stable economy, strong public services, and multiple routes to permanent residence and citizenship.
