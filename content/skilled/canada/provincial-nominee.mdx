### Overview
**PNPs** let provinces select candidates who fit local labour needs. A nomination often adds **600 CRS points**, guaranteeing an ITA in most draws.

### Package Overview
Salaries and benefits depend on the region and occupation. Provincial employer-driven streams may require a job offer that aligns with local wage standards.

### Comparison
- **PNP** suits candidates with provincial ties or in-demand occupations.  
- **Express Entry** suits competitive CRS profiles without specific provincial targeting.

### Why Canada
Provinces offer clear, published criteria and frequent updates to target real labour shortages.
