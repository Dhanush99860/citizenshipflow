introPoints:
  - "Points-tested PR: 189 (independent) and 190 (state nominated)"
  - "Regional provisional 491 → PR via 191 after meeting income/residence rules"
  - "Employer sponsorship — Skills in Demand (subclass 482)"
  - "National Innovation (subclass 858) — exceptional/recognised talent"

overview: |
  Australia’s skilled program combines points-tested visas, state/territory nomination and employer sponsorship.
  For points-tested visas, candidates submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) in SkillSelect and receive invitations based on points and occupation demand. The pass mark is 65 points for GSM; some occupations require higher scores in competitive rounds. Employer sponsorships run under the Skills in Demand (subclass 482) visa (which replaced TSS in December 2024) with salary safeguards (AMSR and TSMIT). Exceptional candidates may qualify for the National Innovation (subclass 858) permanent visa.

keyPoints:
  - Pass mark 65 for GSM; invitations issued via periodic SkillSelect rounds
  - PR on grant for 189/190; 491 is 5-year provisional leading to PR (subclass 191) once criteria are met
  - Employer-sponsored 482 requires meeting market salary and at least the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT); thresholds are indexed annually
  - Family inclusion available across main skilled streams (partner/dependent children)
