### Overview

Subclass 190 is a **points-tested permanent** visa for skilled workers **nominated by an Australian state or territory**. Nomination grants **+5 points**, but you must meet that state’s skills list and criteria in addition to national requirements.

### Why Australia (190)

- PR on grant with family inclusion
- +5 points from nomination (often helpful for competitive occupations)
- Transparent, published state occupation lists and criteria

### State Focus

Each state/territory runs its own **nomination program** with lists and criteria that change in-year. Review the target state’s page (e.g., NSW, SA, WA) before lodging.
