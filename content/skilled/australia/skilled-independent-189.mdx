### Overview
Subclass 189 is a **points-tested permanent residence** visa for invited workers. You must submit an **EOI in SkillSelect**, meet the **65-point pass mark**, be **under 45 at invitation**, have a **positive skills assessment**, and meet at least **Competent English**.

### Why Australia (189)
- PR on grant; live and work anywhere  
- No sponsor or state nomination required  
- Transparent points system and published invitation rounds

### Comparison
**189 vs 190 (state nominated)** — 189 has no nomination obligations but is often more competitive on points. **190** grants PR as well, and nomination provides **+5 points**, but you must meet state criteria and settlement expectations.

### Notes on Competitiveness
Recent national invitation rounds show fluctuating volumes by occupation. Higher points and recent experience/English often improve competitiveness.
