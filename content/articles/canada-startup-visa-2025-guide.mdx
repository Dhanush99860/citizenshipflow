  title="What is the Start-Up Visa?"
  intro="Canada’s Start-Up Visa (SUV) grants permanent residence to founders building an innovative, scalable business that is supported by a government-designated organization (incubator, angel group, or venture capital fund)."
>
  <Callout title="Who qualifies?" variant="info">
    You’ll need an innovative business concept, a <strong>Letter of Support</strong> from a designated organization, <strong>CLB 5</strong> language ability, sufficient settlement funds, and an intention to live <em>outside Québec</em>.
  </Callout>
</Section>

## Core eligibility

- **Letter of Support (LoS)** from a designated incubator, angel group, or VC fund (the organization also sends a Commitment Certificate to IRCC).
- **Qualifying business** that can create jobs in Canada and compete globally.
- **Ownership & control** that meets SUV voting-rights rules (see below).
- **Language**: at least **CLB 5** in English/French.
- **Settlement funds**: enough money to support yourself and dependants after landing.
- **Admissibility**: medical, biometrics, police certificates, and background checks.

## Designated organizations (DOs)

Canada authorizes three DO types to issue Letters of Support:

### Incubators
Best fit for early-stage teams looking for structured programming, mentorship and community. Many run fixed-cohort programs and assess fit, founder/market insight, execution plan, and Canadian jobs angle.

### Angel groups
Focus on early financing and mentor networks. Most expect evidence of <em>traction</em> (paying users, pilots, LOIs) and a clear plan for use of funds in Canada.

### Venture capital funds
VCs back companies with significant market potential and scalable models. They evaluate team quality, defensibility, pathway to scale, and whether core operations will be built in Canada.

<Callout title="Essential vs non-essential applicants" variant="warning">
  Up to <strong>five</strong> owners can be included. A DO may mark one or more founders as <em>essential</em>. If an essential founder’s application is refused or withdrawn, the entire file can be refused.
</Callout>

## Ownership & control — quick rules

- Each applying founder must hold **≥ 10%** of the voting rights.
- All applying founders **plus** the designated organization(s) must jointly hold **> 50%** of the voting rights.
- Maintain qualifying ownership and control **from application to landing**.
- The business must be incorporated in Canada (usually during/after DO process) and carry on business in Canada.

## Language & funds

<Callout title="Practical checklist" variant="success">
  Target CLB 5 (common pathway is IELTS General). Keep settlement funds liquid and verifiable. Align cap table to the SUV thresholds, document roles/vesting, and keep founder employment agreements tidy.
</Callout>

### Language (CLB 5)
CLB 5 corresponds to a modest intermediate ability in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Most founders meet it with popular tests (e.g., IELTS General, CELPIP, TEF/TCF). Scores change by test format—always check the official CLB conversion when booking your test.

### Settlement funds
IRCC updates minimum funds annually. Treat the table as a floor; founders with dependants or higher burn should plan above the minimum. Funds must be <em>readily available</em> and traceable.

## Step-by-step: from idea to PR

<Steps>
  <Step title="Shape a qualifying business">
    Clarify the problem, solution, target market, moat, and your <strong>Canada plan</strong> (hiring, R&amp;D, partnerships). Draft a lean business plan and a 10–12 slide pitch deck.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engage designated organizations">
    Shortlist relevant incubators/angels/VCs. Tailor the deck, highlight traction and Canada activities, and prepare for diligence (market sizing, GTM, IP/tech, cap table, references).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure the Letter of Support">
    On acceptance, your DO issues an LoS to you and files a Commitment Certificate directly with IRCC. Confirm if any founders are marked <em>essential</em>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File the PR application">
    Submit forms, LoS, police certificates, medicals/biometrics, language proof, and settlement funds. Keep your corporate records (share registers, resolutions) well organized.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Work permit">
    Many founders obtain an LMIA-exempt work permit (SUV stream or other C-codes) to build in Canada while PR is processing. This is optional and depends on timing and business needs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Documents you’ll prepare

- Passports & civil status documents for all applicants.
- Language test results meeting **CLB 5**.
- Proof of **settlement funds** (bank letters/statements).
- Police certificates, medical exams, and biometrics.
- Corporate set: articles, share register/cap table, founder agreements, option/vesting docs, IP assignments.
- Business evidence: deck, plan, traction (users, pilots, contracts), Canada activity plan.
- **Letter of Support** (your copy) and DO **Commitment Certificate** (sent by DO to IRCC).

## Processing & timeline

SUV is not a fast-track by default. Timelines vary by DO evaluation, founder readiness, and IRCC queues. Founders who must start in Canada sooner often use a temporary work permit while PR runs in parallel.

<Callout title="Keep your file current" variant="tip">
  Update IRCC if you change roles, ownership, address, or family composition. Notify your DO of major milestones; they may be contacted by IRCC.
</Callout>

## Costs & fees (typical buckets)

- IRCC application fees & biometrics for each applicant.
- Medical exam and police certificate costs.
- DO program fees or investment terms (varies by organization).
- Company formation, tax, and legal housekeeping in Canada.

## After PR — what to expect

- **PR card** on landing and access to provincial health coverage (after any applicable waiting period).
- Ability to live and work anywhere in Canada **except Québec** (SUV is a federal program outside Québec).
- Keep basic residency days to maintain PR; citizenship may be available after meeting physical presence rules.

## Common pitfalls

- Rushing DO outreach with a generic deck and no Canada plan.
- Cap tables that fail the **10%** & **>50%** voting-rights rules.
- Settlement funds that are locked, untraceable, or below the annual minimum.
- Language results below CLB 5 or expired test reports.
- Marking a clearly non-critical founder as “essential”.
