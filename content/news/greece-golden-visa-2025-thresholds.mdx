## New minimums (real estate)

- **€800,000** — high-demand zones (e.g., most of **Athens/Attica**, **Thessaloniki**, **Mykonos**, **Santorini**). Often paired with a **single property** of **≥ 120 m²**.  
- **€400,000** — most other regions, typically a **single property** of **≥ 120 m²**.  
- **€250,000 (special)** — limited, policy-defined cases (e.g., restoration of listed buildings or specific conversions), subject to documentable proof and pre-clearance.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Why size and zoning matter">
  Under the new regime, **combining multiple smaller units** often won’t qualify. Many municipalities require a **single qualifying title** meeting the minimum **and** the **≥ 120 m²** rule. Always validate zoning, permitted use (residential vs. touristic), and short-let restrictions <em>before</em> you commit funds.
</Callout>

## Practical implications for investors

- **Stock scarcity in prime areas:** €800k + 120 m² narrows inventory in central Athens; pricing and due-diligence quality now weigh more heavily.  
- **Developer products are reshaping:** Expect larger-unit launches and fewer “split-title” strategies.  
- **€250k exception is narrow:** Treat it as **case-by-case**, not a mainstream route. Documentation and approvals must be watertight.

## Process notes (unchanged core flow)

1. Property selection & reservation with **title/permit checks**.  
2. **NIE/AFM** tax number, Greek bank account (where applicable).  
3. Purchase completion (notary deed, registry).  
4. File **Golden Visa** application (biometrics, insurance, clean record).  
5. **Family inclusion** available (spouse/partner, dependent children; parents subject to rules in force).

<Callout variant="info" title="Compare with alternatives">
  If your primary goal is EU mobility with flexible holding periods, you may wish to model **Portugal’s fund route** (no real-estate requirement) against Greece’s larger-unit criteria. We can prepare a side-by-side of **costs, day-count, renewals, exit, and timelines** for each family profile.
</Callout>

## Next steps

- Shortlist **zones** and confirm which minimum applies for your target address.  
- Obtain a **document checklist** (title, ENFIA/utility, energy cert., planning history).  
- Have a Greek counsel/notary run **municipal-level confirmations** (size/usage rules).  
- Align your **timeline** (purchase → biometrics → card issue) with travel plans.
