  <Callout variant="info" title="Minimums that remain">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Funds:</strong> €500,000 into a qualifying fund supervised by CMVM.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural patronage:</strong> €250,000 (reduced in low-density areas).</li>

## Eligible paths in 2025

### CMVM-regulated investment funds (popular)
Units in qualifying venture/private-equity or other compliant vehicles that invest in Portugal. Funds publish offering docs, KYC, and periodic reporting.

### Cultural patronage
Support accredited cultural projects/institutions. Lower thresholds may apply in low-density municipalities; diligence is essential to ensure compliance and execution.

### Research / Company routes
Direct participation in research bodies or Portuguese companies with job creation. These routes are less passive and require tighter business planning and counsel.

<Callout variant="warning" title="What’s out since 2023">
  Direct real-estate purchases and most related SPV structures no longer qualify for the Golden Visa.
</Callout>

## Roadmap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your goal">
    Clarify priorities: residency access vs. return profile; family size; travel timelines; appetite for illiquidity and risk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Shortlist funds">
    Check strategy, audited track record, fee stack, redemption windows, lock-ups, <em>gates</em>, reporting cadence (NAV/financials), independent custodian, and auditor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="KYC, NIF & banking">
    Obtain a Portuguese NIF, open an account, and complete the fund’s AML/KYC. Prepare source-of-funds evidence early.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to the fund">
    Execute the subscription docs and wire the €500k (plus fund costs/fees if applicable). Retain proof of subscription for the application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File with AIMA">
    Your law firm lodges the ARI application with AIMA (the agency that succeeded SEF). Attend biometrics once scheduled and respond to any document requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Renewals & day-count">
    Keep insurance, clean record, and minimum physical presence (historically ~7 days/year average). Renew on time and maintain your investment as required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Year 5 → PR/Citizenship">
    If eligible, apply for permanent residence or citizenship (language A2, good conduct, ties). Keep documentation of stays and investment continuity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fund selection checklist

- CMVM registration and compliant offering documents (prospectus/KID).
- Clear strategy and portfolio rules (sector, stage, leverage, concentration limits).
- Governance: GP/manager credentials, IC process, conflicts policy.
- Fees and carry/waterfall, hurdle, and clawback mechanics.
- Independent administrator, custodian/bank, and auditor.
- Liquidity: lock-up, redemptions, side-pockets, suspension/gate provisions.
- Reporting: NAV frequency, investor letters, AGM cadence.
- Exit plan and expected holding periods relative to 5-year GV horizon.

<Callout variant="success" title="Risk hygiene">
  Stress-test liquidity horizons and exit clauses. Avoid single-asset or highly concentrated exposure. Ask for audited financials, look-through to material underlying holdings, and verify CMVM references independently.
</Callout>

## Costs & practicalities

- **AIMA fees** and residence card issuance per applicant.
- **Biometrics, police certificates, medical insurance.**
- **Fund costs** (subscription costs, management fees, carry/performance where applicable).
- **Legal & translations**; courier and notarizations as needed.

## Family, presence & tax notes

- **Family coverage:** spouse/partner, dependent children; dependent parents may be possible case-by-case.
- **Presence:** maintain the minimum physical presence (commonly managed as ~7 days/year on average across the permit period).
- **Tax:** GV doesn’t itself confer tax residency. Seek independent tax advice on domiciles, reporting (e.g., CRS/FATCA), and any Portuguese regimes that may apply.
